# WEBD 5000 - Assignment 1 

##  Basic Desktop Website

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the assignment.  
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

###  Important Note: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

##  Overview

You are tasked with coming up with a site design for one of the following small businesses:

 - Acme Adventure Travel
 - Acme Financial Services
 - Acme Medical Clinic
 - Acme Restaurant
 - Other\*

\* If none of these options interests you, feel free to propose another small business idea to the instructor for pre-approval.

Why **Acme**? Because the instructor is a Wile E. Coyote fan and Acme was the company where he got all his less-than-useful gadgets. I just know he is going to catch that Roadrunner one of these days. I suppose I am dating myself with this reference.

## Website Requirements

- The site should have at least three pages\* (e.g. Home, Contact, About, Services, etc.) with a menu with internal links to every page.
 - The site should have at least a couple external links to relevant websites, which should open in a new browser tab, but they do not need to be in the main menu. 
 - The site should be **well-populated with content**. You may use *Lorem Ipsum* for paragraph text, but should have actually relevant headings. 
 - The site should have an interesting collection of relevant images. Try to use Stock photos, Creative Commons licensed images, and generally avoid copyright infringement. 
 - If you want to embed a video or two under similar guidelines as above for images, be my guest. Chapter 8 of the textbook could be of help with this.
 - The site should have a **visually pleasing and consistent layout** for all pages. If one page seems to need its own layout/styles (e.g. perhaps a Menu page for the restaurant), that is fine, but there should still be an overall set of styles and colours for the website. If you are struggling to pick out a good color scheme for your website, do not despair as I said we are developers not designers, feel free to use an online tool to help out such as one listed here [How to Choose Color Scheme for Website](https://www.upwork.com/resources/how-to-choose-color-scheme-for-website)  
 - Employ a **grid-based layout** for the site as that is the only modern website layout technique we have learned so far. If you have learned another equally modern way to layout webpages before such as Flexboxes and would like to do that instead, just clear it with the instructor first.
 - The site should look good on various desktop resolutions. We can ignore mobile devices for now, that will come soon after this assignment.
 - You should have three stylesheets. One, for basic styles, one for the layout, and a reset. Feel free to get a freely available reset stylesheet from the Internet such as [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), but make sure to credit/source it with an HTML comment when you link it in.
 - **All HTML and CSS code should validate successfully** on their respective W3C Validation sites. 
 
\* If you have previous web development experience and or interest in **Single Page Websites**, you can meet the spirit of the above requirements by still having a main menu that navigates you down to separate sections of the single page for the whole site.

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. VS Code within your GitHub Codespace) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 1 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
