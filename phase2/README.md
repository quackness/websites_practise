# WEBD 5000 - Assignment 2 

##  Mobile-friendly Website

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the assignment.  
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

###  Important Note #1: 

If you decide to continue working on the business idea you used for Assignment #1, you will want to **copy your files from that Assignment into this repository**.

###  Important Note #2: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

##  Overview

Acme Inc. was very pleased with the Desktop design that you came up with for the previous Assignment\*. However, a majority of their customers visit the site on mobile devices (i.e. cell phones and tablets) and it is absolutely critical to their business model to have a website that **displays well and fully works on all devices**. For marketing reasons, they would also like to differentiate the designs of the website for both desktop and mobile and hope to have a different colour scheme for the mobile site.

\* *If for some reason you are very unhappy or bored with your previous company choice from the last assignment, you **could** pick a new one for this assignment, but it would be quite a bit more work as the task here is to have a site that looks good on all devices including desktop so you would still need all design and content for desktop layout*.

## Website Requirements

All of the previous requirements from the last Assignment remain, with the additions noted below.

In order to support all devices, they would like the following:

 - a nice horizontal menu filling the width of the page on tablets/desktops
 - maintain a grid-based layout on desktop devices
 - an alternative menu design that hides the menu until selected (e.g. uses a **navicon**) on mobile devices and that is not horizontally laid out
 - sidebar content that displays on desktop, but is hidden on mobile devices
 - a single-column mobile layout that avoids any horizontal scrolling
 - a **different colour scheme** for mobile that both differentiates the mobile site theme and also allows for comfortable viewing in different lighting environments
 - **all HTML and CSS code should still validate successfully** on their respective W3C Validation sites. 

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. VS Code within your GitHub Codespace) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Assignment 2 Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
